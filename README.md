Project-1: This webpage will exhibit a fictional record store, Subterranean Activities. I will be using the logo from my own company and photos from free outside sources. My goal for this website is to provide users easy access to location of store, general information, and way to contact. I also wanted my navigation menue to be located under the logo as seen on other web vinyl collector web pages. 
The google maps provides fictional location (My company address). The "Get directions" button provides directions to location in google maps from current location. 
There is a mission statement about the store and owners goal.
There is also a submit section in which the user can provide an email and recieve updates on sales and events.
The events page provides a side scrole carousel showing 3 events the store is providing and the user can click on the event which would take them to another page with more info on the event. The contact page is set up for the user to provide first and last name, phone number, email, and any comments which would be sent to the owners. when hitting the send button, I had set it up to back fire if the user has not provided any needed info such as first and last name, as well as email. 
Technologies used, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, and JavaScript. 
Ideas for futer improvment
1- Have a product page which could list a pick of the week and users could purchase through the webpage.
2- Have a community page wich collectors could share their love for music into a group chat.
3- Include another carousel on the home page that shows pictures of the fictional store so users have a better understanding of what the store provides.
